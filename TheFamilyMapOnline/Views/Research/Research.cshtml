            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>The Family Map was developed and tested with three major sociocultural groups: European Americans, African Americans, and Latinos. It was developed in close collaboration with and modified based on conversations with families, classroom educators, home visitors, administrators, and other staff working with families. The development process included an extensive literature review, the identification and evaluation of existing screening tools/items, and a cyclical process of field testing new items, revising, and repeating field testing.</p>
            <p>We have documented this process in publications and continue to research the usefulness of the Family Map.</p>
