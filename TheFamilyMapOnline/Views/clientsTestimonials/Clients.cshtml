                <h2>I&#8217;m Convinced</h2>
                <p>This training was very informative and shed a different light on Family Map!  I hope that this training/trainer is used often.  The manual is great and will be useful for all purposes!</p>

                <h2>Staff Success</h2>
                <p>&#8220;I was trained a few years back and have implemented FMI for the Preschool Head Start families.  I have 20 family advocates that provide the direct services and have really grown to appreciate the Family MAPS Inventory tool.  There was fear at first because of the tools size and the depth of questions asked, however my advocates love it!   It was great watching the staff grow over the past years with this tool. We have seasoned staff; one has worked</p>
