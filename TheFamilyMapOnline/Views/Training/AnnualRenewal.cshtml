            <h1>Annual Renewal</h1>
            <p>Once an agency has used the Family Map for a year, the Family Map team will work with the program to renew its authorization.</p>
            <p>Programs are offered either a one-hour web-based session or onsite training, where we address updates from the past year.  This continuing education is necessary for your agency to maintain the fidelity of the Family Map and to continue receiving access to our tools, technical support, and online learning opportunities.</p>
